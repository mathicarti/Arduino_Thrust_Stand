# Arduino Thrust Stand Monitor
# Project description
This is project is for my EE assignment, I am using an Arduino to control the propeller motor, and a load cell to measure thrust, and log it to an excel file.

## Material
| Description | Quantity |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Arduino|x1|
|Jumper wires |x10|
|Breadboard (sml)|x1|
|ESC (motor controller)|x1|
|BLDC Motor|x1|
|3-5 kg Load Cell|x1|
|HX711 Load Cell Amplifier|x1|
|3D printed Motor-Load Cell Mount|x1|
|OR laser with light sensor |x1|
|Vernier Photogate with Data Logger|x1|
|Clamps|x2|

## How to use
First, flash the Arduino with ``Thrust_Stand_Submitter.ino``, note the port of the USB then close the Arduino app. Plug in your arduino, **THEN** plug in your battery, and then run ``controller.py``.
